# 🏌⛳️ Hex Golf
A simple 2D golf game!
- The distance you can hit is randomly generated each swing
- The distance is highest for the fairway, lower on the putting green, and lowest in the sandtraps
- Try to reach the target hex in the least number of swings!

Try it for youself [here](https://chris-lawrie.github.io/hex_golf/)
